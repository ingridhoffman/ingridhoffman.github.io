# Portfolio for Ingrid Hoffman

Welcome to my professional portfolio site. This website is intended to provide
useful information about me to potential employers, clients, and colleagues.

- Built on React
- Custom responsive CSS
- react-scroll - single page scrolling navigation
- react-hook-form - form validation

### To fix ASAP...

- Need to implement collapsible sidebar for mobile viewing
- Contact form does not yet have functionality

### When I have some extra time...

- Quote of the day in header - utilize AWS database?
- add icons for technologies used on projects
- add carousel for more project info
